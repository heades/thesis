Lets consider the infinite stream of ones. 
\begin{center}
  \begin{math}
    [[1 :: 1 :: 1 :: 1]] \cdots
  \end{math}
\end{center}
Now what can be said about such an object?  We definitely can make observations about it.
That is, we can observe that, say, the first element is a $1$.  In addition to that we can 
observe that the second element is also a $1$.  Furthermore, we can make the observation 
that what follows the second element is still an infinite streams of ones.
We can define this stream using a few morphisms.  That is $[[head]] : [[A]] \to \{1\}$ and
$[[next]] : [[A]] \to [[A]]$ are the morphisms, where $[[A]]$ is some fixed set.
Now notice that for any $a \in [[A]]$ we have $[[head]](a) = 1$, and 
$[[head]](a) = a' \in A$.  Now if we compose these two we obtain 
$[[head]]([[next]](a)) = [[head]](a') = 1$.  Thus, using these morphisms we can completely
define our stream above by taking for each position $n \in \mathbb{N}$ in the stream 
$[[head]]([[next]]^{n}(a))$ to be the value at that position for any $a \in [[A]]$.  These
two morphisms $[[head]]$ and $[[next]]$ are the observations we can make about the element 
$a$. It just happens, in this simple example, that the observations are the same for all 
elements of $[[A]]$.

At this point we can take the product of the two morphisms $[[head]]$ and $[[next]]$ to
obtain the morphism $\langle [[head]],[[next]] \rangle : [[A]] \to \{1\} \times [[A]]$.
If we define the functor $[[F]]([[x]]) := \{1\} \times [[x]]$ then we can redefine the
product as $\langle [[head]],[[next]] \rangle : [[A]] \to [[F]]([[A]])$.  Furthermore,
if we make $\{1\}$ arbitrary and call it say $[[B]]$ then we obtain 
the functor $[[F]]([[x]]) := [[B]] \times [[x]]$.  Using this new definition of the functor
$[[F]]$ and $\langle [[head]],[[next]] \rangle : [[A]] \to [[F]]([[A]])$ we can define any
infinite stream of elements of $[[B]]$.  Taking the functor $[[F]]$ and the pair
$([[B]], \langle [[head]], [[next]] \rangle)$ we obtain what is called a coalgebra.
